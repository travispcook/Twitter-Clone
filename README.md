Use this repo as the starting point for the Twitter clone project:

## PART ONE ##
* Fork the repo
* Get familiar with the html/css
* Use jQuery to add the following features:
  * Initially, the Tweet button and the character count button should be hidden (CSS).
  * When the user clicks on the textarea, the textarea should double in size and the character count and Tweet buttons should be revealed.
  * As the user types, the character count should decrease.
  * When there are 10 or less characters, the character counter should turn red.
  * If the user puts in more than 140 characters, the tweet button should be disabled (and re-enabled when there are <= 140 chars).
  * When the user successfully inputs characters and clicks the “Tweet” button, a new tweet should be created and added to the tweet stream in the main column, using the user’s fake profile image in the top left and username/fullname.
